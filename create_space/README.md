# create_space subfolder

This subdirectory shows an example of how to create perturbations/noise and add them to the clean audio file. For downloading the original dataset, refer to the ***dataset*** subfolder in this repo.

This perturbation list is in no way exhaustive. For more elaborate information on the perturbations we use, refer to the original [paper](link). As an example, we present two perturbations: white_noise and mp3_compression. The noise levels range from 0 to 100 -> the higher the level, the more the noise you want.
